Badger Screw FAQ
Product Goal
A direct-to-MUA screw engineered for the Goldilocks Zone: maximum clamping force with minimum screw-channel stress.

Radiused clamping surface distributes load evenly around shaft and head
Vertical clamping priority reduces lateral stress
Smaller screw head (enabled by shaft-based retention) preserves prosthetic material and increases prosthetic strength
