NOTE: Most printers require a 0.1 mm offset. Most problems pertaining to screw fit (tight or too loose) is for offset.
Badger Screw Exocad Help:

Issue: the access channel in a 3D printed prototype was too narrow for their 1.4 mm Badger screws, which have a 2.0 mm head.

Cause: The lab used the milling library in Exocad instead of the 3D printing library, which is better suited for printing and includes offset options to accommodate printer variability.
Solution:

Switch to the 3D printing library from Smart Mouth Technologies: Library Link
Use the offset dropdown in Exocad (typically 0.1 mm works best).
Print a calibration block to determine the ideal offset for your printer.
Share the correct offset with your designer for future cases.


Resources Provided:

Additional Note: Smart Mouth Technologies is collaborating with Conmetior and plans to release a reamer soon. [Fw: Badger...xocad Help | Outlook]


Badger Study":

Topic: Calibration and printing accuracy for Badger Screws in dental prosthetics.
Question: How to ensure perfect fit in Formlabs 4B printer.?
Key Points:

New Smile Columbus is printing in-office using a Formlabs 4B printer.
They tested screw channel offsets and found values between +0.05 mm and +0.1 mm, with 0.05 mm at the top of the line and 0.1 mm in the middle.
we recommend using a 0.1 mm offset, which is typical for most printers.
A calibration block should be printed to determine the correct offset for accurate screw channel dimensions.
The offset value should be communicated to the lab so it can be incorporated into the design.
For final prosthetics, the Exocad library should be used without offsets.


Inquiry: Requested information about bulk pricing for Badger Screws and digital libraries to support them.

Follow-up:

They use Sprintray printers.
Smart Mouth Technologies recommended using a 3D Printing Calibration Block to ensure accurate screw channel printing.
Most printers require a 0.1 mm offset, which should be communicated to the designer.



"Website Contact Us Form":



Issue: He ordered two bags of screws and used them for a patient case, but the exocad library didn’t work properly—the screw access holes were too narrow for the screw heads.


Setup:

Design was done by Hybridge implant lab
Printed using Onyx2 resin on a Sprintray Pro2 printer



Problem: He had to manually widen the access holes, which led to guesswork.


Question: Is this a design lab issue or a common problem when using exocad?


Response from Smart Mouth Technologies:

The issue is likely due to tight screw access channels caused by printer variability.
They recommend using a 3D printing library and a calibration block to determine the correct offset for the printer.
Once the offset is known, it should be shared with the designer to ensure proper fit.

Milling Software Compatibility:

Hyperdent:

Integrated with Badger
For angled screw channels, only compatible with T-cutter enabled machines


VHF:

Requires offsets for proper milling
Most users use +0.05 mm offset, but larger offsets are available
A design library is attached to help determine the correct offset





Exocad Instructions:

Place the Badger 3D Printing Exocad Library in the “implant” folder
Select the correct MUA/Badger Screw interface during design
