NOTE: Most printers require a 0.1 mm offset. Most problems pertaining to screw fit (tight or too loose) is for offset.

# Last Updated: November 11, 2025

## 1. DOWNLOAD & INSTALL THE BADGER SCREW LIBRARY

- Visit **https://smartmouthtechnologies.com/libraries/**
- Download the **Badger Screw 3D Printing Library** (includes:
  - Universal MUA (most common)
  - Nobel Biocare® compatible interface
  - Straumann® compatible interface
  - Calibration block STL
)
- Import the library into your CAD software:
  - **Exocad**: File > Open Library > Select .elib file
  - **HyperDent**: Resources > Implant Libraries > Import
  - **Mill Box**: Libraries > Import Geometry

> **Note**: Angled screw channels require **T-cutter enabled mills**. Do **NOT** angle channels if your mill lacks T-cutters.

---

## 2. CALIBRATE YOUR 3D PRINTER (REQUIRED FOR ACCURACY)

1. **Print the Calibration Block**
   - Load the **Badger Screw Calibration Block STL**
   - Use your standard resin and print settings
   - Print **flat on the build plate** (no rotation needed)

2. **Measure Each Hole with a Digital Caliper**
   - Measure **X and Y diameters** of all test holes
   - Record actual vs. expected values

3. **Calculate Offset**
   - Example: Expected = 2.00 mm | Actual = 2.10 mm → **Offset = +0.1 mm**

4. **Apply Offset in CAD Library**
   - In the Badger Screw library settings:
     - Set **Global Offset = +0.1 mm** (or your measured value)
     - Save as default for future cases

---
NOTE: In MOST cases +0.1 mm** Offset will work


## 3. DESIGNING WITH BADGER SCREW IN YOUR CAD SOFTWARE

### Step-by-Step (Exocad Example – Works Similarly in HyperDent/Mill Box)

1. **Open Your Arch Design**
   - Load patient scan + opposing + construction info

2. **Identify Implant Interfaces**
   - Go to: **Part Features > Implant Interface**
   - Click **Select All** → All screw channels highlight **yellow**

3. **Replace Screw Geometry**
   - In the **External Tab**, click the **folder icon**
   - Navigate to:  
     `Library > CAM Geometries > Badger Screw > Universal MUA`
   - Select the **Badger Screw** model
   - Confirm: New screw = **yellow** | Old screw = **gray**

4. **Verify Fit**
   - Zoom in: Confirm **Badger Screw head (2mm)** is fully seated
   - No overlap with prosthetic anatomy
   - Screw channel diameter = **2.04 mm**

5. **Apply Printer Offset**
   - In library settings: Enter your **calibration offset** (e.g., 0.1 mm)
   - Software auto-compensates during export

---

## 4. PREPARING BADGER SCREW VERIFICATION BLOCKS FOR PRINTING

1. **Export STL**
   - File > Export > **Verification Block STL**

2. **Open in Slicer (e.g., ChiTuBox, Lychee, PreForm)**
   - Drag and drop the STL

3. **Orient Correctly**
   - Look for **"FLAT" label on top surface**
   - **Rotate 180°** so **FLAT side is on build plate**
   - Confirm: No supports needed in screw channels

4. **Add Supports (Standard Settings)**
   - Medium density
   - Avoid screw channels and critical surfaces

5. **Slice & Print**
   - Use validated resin (e.g., Formlabs Surgical Guide, NextDent C&B)
   - Post-cure per resin specs

---

## 5. MILLING BADGER SCREW ARCHES (HYPERDENT / MILL BOX)

- After replacing screw geometry in CAD:
  - Export **construction info + arch STL**
  - Open in **HyperDent** or **Mill Box**
  - Toolpath will automatically use **Badger Screw library**
  - Use **1.0 mm end mill** for screw channels
  - Confirm **no collisions** in simulation

---

## 6. TROUBLESHOOTING & BEST PRACTICES

| Issue | Solution |
|------|----------|
Issue | Screw channel too tight 
Solution| Increase **printer offset** by +0.05 mm |
Issue | Screw head not seating 
Solution| Verify **Universal MUA** selected (not Nobel/Straumann) |
Issue | Supports in screw channel 
Solution| Re-orient block with **FLAT side down** |
Issue | Angled channels failing 
Solution| Confirm mill has **T-cutter**; otherwise, keep channels **straight** |

---

## QUICK SUMMARY

1. **Download + Calibrate** → Print & measure calibration block
2. **Import Library** → Set offset in CAD
3. **Replace Screw** → Select Badger Screw in implant interface
4. **Export & Print** → Rotate FLAT side down, add supports
5. **Mill** → Use 1.0 mm tool, verify simulation
