NOTE: Most printers require a 0.1 mm offset. Most problems pertaining to screw fit (tight or too loose) is for offset.

Q & A Summary – Badger Screw Protocol & Driver Use
Q: When should I use a straight driver vs. an angled ball hex driver?

A:

Use the straight driver most of the time.

Use the angled ball hex driver only when screw channels are angled more than ~10°, which is required to properly torque Badger screws.

Q: Why do you always start with the straight driver?

A:
The straight driver retains the screw much better than a ball driver. It allows you to:

Deliver the screw into the access hole intraorally.

Give the screw a few turns to engage the MUA threads.
After that, you can safely switch to the angled driver for final torque.

Q: What is the exact protocol for delivering Badger screws in angled screw channels?

A:

Place the Badger screw on a straight driver.

Insert into the access hole and turn it a few rotations until it engages the MUA threads.

Remove the straight driver.

Place all remaining screws; for straight channels, snug them to ~10 Ncm.

Switch to the angled ball driver and torque all screws in a star pattern:

15 Ncm for polymers (resin, PMMA)

20 Ncm for zirconia

Fill the access: PTFE tape first, then 2 mm of ClipFlow, light cure 10 seconds.

Q: What straight driver do you recommend as a more affordable option?

A:
A good, cost-effective choice is the Dess 1.2 mm / 0.48" hex driver. (Link provided separately.)

Q: What causes most screw-fitting issues?

A:
Most of the time, screw-fitting problems stem from not having the correct prescribed offset. Ensuring the offset is properly re-scribed is critical for ideal seating and torque.

Q: Do you sell in UK or Canada or Mexico or Europe?

A:
Right now we only sell in the US. But we are working on going international
