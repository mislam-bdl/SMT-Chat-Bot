MAIN PRODUCTS
================================================================================

PRODUCT 1: BADGER SCREW (Patent Pending)
---
What It Is: A revolutionary direct-to-MUA (multi-unit abutment) screw engineered
for maximum clamping force with minimum prosthetic stress.

Key Innovation: Radiused cupped clamping surface distributes load evenly around
shaft and head, reducing lateral stress while maintaining high retention.

Primary Use: Direct-to-MUA restorations only. NOT compatible with single-unit
Ti-base restorations (incorrect thread pattern).

BADGER SCREW SPECIFICATIONS
---
Head Diameter: 2.00 mm
Screw-Channel Diameter: 2.04 mm
Clamping Force: ~136 N (newtons)
Screw-Channel Stress: ~35 MPa (megapascals)
Driver Type: 0.048" hex (1.22 mm) - required due to reduced head size
Contact Area: 4.5 mm² (optimized cupped design vs flat competitors)
Material: Anodized finish for durability
Thread Pattern: M1.4
Angle Correction: Not available (rarely needed with smaller head design)
Can Be Milled: Yes, with 1mm endmill

BADGER SCREW PERFORMANCE vs COMPETITORS
---
Badger Screw Initial Clamping Force: ~330 N
Badger Screw Settled Force: ~310 N

Competitor Comparison (Settled Force):
- Badger Screw: ~310 N (HIGHEST)
- Competitor Screw #1: ~270 N
- Competitor Screw #2: ~260 N
- Competitor Screw #3: ~220 N
- Competitor Screw #4: ~200 N
- Competitor Screw #5: ~100 N (LOWEST)

Contact Area Comparison:
- Badger: 4.5 mm² with cupped seat pulls friction inward, higher clamping force
- DESS: 2.2 mm² small contact area causes pressure spikes and higher stress
- Vortex: 3.1-11 mm² flat wide seat, high friction, lower clamping force
- Powerball: 4.2 mm² flat wide seat, high friction, lower clamping force
- Rosen: 9.5 mm² large contact area, friction too high, consumes torque
- Segscrew: Largest access hole weakens arch

Key Insight: Badger's 4.5 mm² cupped design is optimized for friction distribution
and stress dissipation, NOT largest contact area. Shape matters more than size.

BADGER SCREW PRELOAD (CLAMPING FORCE) BEHAVIOR
---
In Zirconia Prosthesis: Force remains stable over time (~300-350 N after spike)
In PMMA/Printed Resin: Force settles rapidly, can lose up to 100N in seconds

Cyclic Loading Performance (Mouth Simulation - PMMA):
- Badger 15 Ncm: Settles at ~273 N (maintains highest force)
- Badger 20 Ncm: Settles at ~229 N
- Popular Competitor 0.8mm 15 Ncm: Settles at ~195 N
- Popular Competitor 1.4mm 15 Ncm: Settles at ~105 N

RECOMMENDED TORQUE SPECIFICATIONS
---
For Printing (Resin/PMMA): 15 Ncm
For Milling (PMMA): 15 Ncm
For Milling (Zirconia): 20 Ncm
Driver: 0.048" hex (1.2 mm)

IMPORTANT: Badger tested at 35 Ncm shows NO permanent deformation. The "wedge
effect" of angled screws is a MYTH - physical testing shows no wedging or
splitting occurs.

BADGER SCREW DESIGN & SETUP GUIDES
================================================================================

3D PRINTING WITH BADGER SCREW (Exocad Workflow)
---
Step 1: Download & Install Library
- Visit https://smartmouthtechnologies.com/libraries/
- Download Badger Screw 3D Printing Library
- Import into Exocad: File > Open Library > Select .elib file

Step 2: Calibrate Your 3D Printer (REQUIRED)
- Print the Badger Screw Calibration Block STL
- Use standard resin and settings
- Print flat on build plate
- Measure X and Y diameters with digital caliper
- Calculate offset: 
- In most cases +0.1mm offset works

NOTE: Most printers require a 0.1 mm offset.

Step 3: Apply Calibration in CAD
1. Open your arch design
2. Go to Part Features > Implant Interface
3. Click Select All (all screw channels highlight yellow)
4. Click External Tab > folder icon
5. Navigate to Library > CAM Geometries > Badger Screw > Universal MUA
6. Select Badger Screw model
7. Verify: New screw = yellow, old screw = gray
8. Zoom in: Confirm Badger head (2mm) fully seated, no overlap with anatomy
9. Enter calibration offset in library settings (e.g., 0.1mm)

Step 4: Prepare Verification Block
- Export STL: File > Export > Verification Block STL
- Open in slicer (ChiTuBox, Lychee, PreForm)
- Orient with FLAT label on top, rotate 180° so FLAT is on build plate
- Add medium-density supports avoiding screw channels
- Slice and print using validated resin

MILLING BADGER SCREW ARCHES (Hyperdent/Mill Box)
---
Supported CAM Software:
- Hyperdent (updated versions)
- Mill Box (updated versions)

Tools Required:
- Ball endmills (can be used to mill Badger seat)
- Flat endmills (can be used to mill Badger seat)
- Bullnose endmills (can be used to mill Badger seat)
- T-cutters for angled undercuts (1.4mm and 1.6mm sizes)

IMPORTANT: If you can currently mill Powerball, DESS, or Vortex, YOU CAN MILL
BADGER. Use 1.0mm endmill for screw channels. Ball, flat, or bullnose endmills
all work for seat geometry.

Milling Workflow:
1. Replace screw geometry in CAD with Badger Screw
2. Export construction info + arch STL
3. Open in HyperDent or Mill Box
4. Toolpath automatically uses Badger Screw library
5. Use 1.0mm end mill for screw channels
6. Verify no collisions in simulation
7. Do NOT angle channels if your mill lacks T-cutters

TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Screw Channel Too Tight
Solution: Increase printer offset by +0.05mm in calibration settings

Screw Head Not Seating
Solution: Verify "Universal MUA" is selected (not Nobel/Straumann specific)

Supports in Screw Channel
Solution: Re-orient block with FLAT side down before printing

Angled Channels Failing
Solution: Confirm mill has T-cutter capability. If not, keep channels straight.

BADGER SCREW - WHY IT WORKS
================================================================================

Problem Statement: Today's screws focus on FEATURES (price, angle correction,
height adjustability, color) instead of PERFORMANCE.

The Badger Solution: Focuses on measurable PERFORMANCE metrics:
- Access hole diameter (smaller = stronger prosthetic)
- Preload/Clamping Force (higher = stays seated)
- Bearing surface/screw seat stress (lower = longer lifespan)
- Contact area (optimized, not largest)

Badger Design Advantages:
1. Small head (2.00mm) reduces access hole weakening prosthetic
2. Cupped clamping surface (4.5mm² optimized area) pulls friction inward
3. Radiused edges dissipate stress vs sharp corners that concentrate stress
4. Vertical clamping priority reduces lateral stress
5. High preload maintains prosthetic retention throughout prosthesis lifespan

Why Preload Matters: Preload is the ONLY force keeping a full-arch prosthesis
seated. When preload drops, prosthesis eventually loosens, screw backs out, and
failure occurs. Badger maintains the highest preload among tested competitors.

at 35 Ncm with no permanent deformation.

Q: Can I mill Badger if I already mill other screws?
A: Yes. If you mill Powerball, DESS, or Vortex, you can mill Badger. Use 1.0mm
endmill for channels. Ball, flat, or bullnose endmills work for seat.

Q: Do I need a T-cutter for Badger?
A: Only if you want angled screw channels. For straight channels, standard tools
work. If mill lacks T-cutters, keep channels straight.

Q: How do I download the Badger library?
A: Visit https://smartmouthtechnologies.com/libraries/ and select your CAD software
(Exocad, Hyperdent, or Mill Box).

Q: Is WIB FDA-certified?
A: No. WIB is BETA software that identifies stress points but cannot guarantee
outcomes due to real-world variables outside design control.

Q: What screw channels does Badger support?
A: Badger, Powerball, DESS Long (1.4mm thread), DESS Short, and Rosen channel
geometries.

Q: What's the Badger Starter Pack?
A: $2,316 value including 10 Badger Screws plus all 4 driver types (Long/Short,
Straight/Angled). Best value for complete setup.

Q: Is patient data in WIB secure?
